# React Showcase (Blog Site)

This is project number one, of my ReactJS Showcase of projects. These projects are created (or being created), to boost my ReactJS credibility.

## What Did I Use

- ReactJS
- Context API
- Custom Hooks
- Axios
- Sass
- JSON Placeholder

I created a pagination **custom hook**, so that I can reuse it, when need be. Also I know that using **Context API** for this small of a project, is completely unecessary, however may I repeat that this project is purely to show what I know, and what I can build with the ReactJS framework.
